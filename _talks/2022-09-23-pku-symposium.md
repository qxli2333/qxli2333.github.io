This is a talk of 2022 PKU-DoA Undergraduate Astronomy Symposium. In this talk, I introduce my work on subhalo mass measurement from SDSS weak lensing. We use Luo et al. (2017) SDSS DR7 shape catalog to study subhaloes in Yang et al. (2006) group catalog. We find an unreported selection bias between host halo mass and separation between satellite galaxies and their central galaxies. We develop a weigting method to correct this bias. With a 2 free paramater model to describe excess surface density of subhalo, we fit the weighted lensing signal by MCMC. In this talk, I will first introduce galaxy-galaxy lensing method and subhalo density profile, then talk about the methods and main results of this work.
