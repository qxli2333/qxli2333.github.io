This is a talk of cluster seminar of Department of Astronomy, Umich. In this talk, I will focus on our recent work about subhalo properties in Yang et al. (2007) &apos;s group catalog based on SDSS DR7. We devide satellite galaxies into different stellar mass and BCG-center separation bins, then measure the lensing signals around these satellites. We discover an unreported selection effect between separation and host halo mass and use a weighting method to correct it. With a 2 free paramater model to describe excess surface density of subhalo, we fit the weighted lensing signal by MCMC. In this talk, I will first introduce galaxy-galaxy lensing method and subhalo density profile, then talk about the methods and main results of this work.
