This is a talk of Undergraduate Academic Annual Conference of Department of Astronomy, USTC. In this talk, I introduce basic principles of using galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure dark matter halo mass and some recent progress of two of my works, satellite lensing of SDSS and comparison between weak lensing mass and caustic mass.
