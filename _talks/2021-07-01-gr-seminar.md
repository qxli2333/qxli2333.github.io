These are a series of lectures about General Relativity. The seminar is held annually United Academic Forum of Basic Science for Undergraduates, a organization aiming on improving academic levels of undergraduates in China. I am the host of 2021 summer GR seminar and give a series of lectures about basic principles and applications of general relativity. The invited talks of this seminar cover lots of topics, such as the well-posedness of Einstein equation, Lorentz geometry and casual structure, supernova and cosmic expansion and compact objects.
