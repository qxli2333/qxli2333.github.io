'This letter presents, for the first time, direct constraints on the black hole--halo mass relation using weak gravitational lensing measurements. We construct type I and type II Active Galactic Nucleus (AGNs) samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with a mean redshift of $0.4$ $(0.1)$ for type I (type II) AGNs. This sample is cross-correlated with weak lensing shear from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Northern Survey (UNIONS). We compute the excess surface mass density of the halos associated with $36,181$ AGNs from $94,308,561$ lensed galaxies and fit the halo mass in bins of black hole mass. We find that more massive AGNs reside in more massive halos. The relation between halo mass and black hole mass is well described by a power law of slope $0.6$ for both type I and type II samples, in agreement with models that link black hole growth
to baryon feedback.
We see no dependence on AGN type or redshift in the black hole--halo mass relation below a black hole mass of $10^{8.5} M_{\odot}$.
Above that mass,
we find more massive halos for the low-$z$ type II sample compared to the high-$z$ type I sample, but this difference may be interpreted as systematic error in the black hole mass measurements.
Our results are consistent with previous measurements for non-AGN galaxies.
At a fixed black hole mass, our weak-lensing halo masses are consistent with galaxy rotation curves but significantly lower than galaxy clustering measurements. 
Finally, our results are broadly consistent with state-of-the-art hydro-dynamical cosmological simulations, providing a new constraint for black hole masses in simulations.'
