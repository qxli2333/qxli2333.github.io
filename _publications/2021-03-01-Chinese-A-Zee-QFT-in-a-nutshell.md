Chaoli Translation Collaboration is a group of science textbooks and papers translators. We translate the textbooks we love into Chinese so that more students in China can access to the most interesting books in the world. **I participated the translation work of A. Zee's *Quantum Field Thoery in a Nutshell* as a main proofreader.**
