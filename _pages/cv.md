Research experience
======
* : Subhalo Properties From SDSS Satellte Lensing
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo and Prof. Huiyuan Wang
  * State: To be submitted to ApJ
  * Abstract: In this work, we apply galaxy-galaxy lensing, a powful method to constrain halo properties, to satellite galaxies in Yang's SDSS group catalog. With the largest lens sample among state-of-art satellite lensing works, we find a unreported selection effect. We develop a weighting method to correct this bias.
