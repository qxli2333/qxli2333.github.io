  * Abstract: We conduct, for the first time, direct constraints on the black-hole-to-halo-mass relation using weak gravitational lensing measurements. We construct type I and type II Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) samples from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with a mean redshift of 0.4-0.1 for type I (type II) AGNs. This sample is cross-correlated with weak lensing shear from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Northern Survey (UNIONS). We compute the excess surface mass density of the halos associated with 36,181 AGNs from 94,308,561 lensed galaxies and fit the halo mass in bins of black-hole mass. We find that more massive AGNs reside in more massive halos. We see no evidence of dependence on AGN type or redshift in the black-hole-to-halo-mass relationship when systematic errors in the measured black-hole masses are included. Our results are consistent with previous measurements for non-AGN galaxies. At a fixed black-hole mass, our weak-lensing halo masses are consistent with galaxy rotation curves, but significantly lower than galaxy clustering measurements. Finally, our results are broadly consistent with state-of-the-art hydro-dynamical cosmological simulations, providing a new constraint for black-hole masses in simulations.
  
* **Subhalo Properties From SDSS Lensing**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo (USTC) and Prof. Huiyuan Wang (USTC)
  * State: To be submitted to ApJ
  * Time: July 2021 
  * Abstract: In this work, we apply galaxy-galaxy lensing, a powerful method to constrain halo properties, to group member galaxies in Yang's SDSS group catalog. We constrain the subhalo-to-stellar mass relation.
  <!-- * With the largest lens sample among state-of-art satellite lensing works, we **find an unreported selection effect**. We develop a weighting method to correct this bias. We find that for high stellar mass satellites, there is not any strong $M_{sub}-R_{sep}$ dependence. However, for low stellar mass satellites, a 2$\sigma$ significantly positive slope is found for $\log M_{sub}-R_{sep}$. It indicates that **smaller subhalo suffers more sever tidal stripping**. -->

  * Time: July 2022 -
  * State: **Data access proposal approved**. Primary results got, still testing.
  * Abstract: $M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ relation has been discussed since Ferrarese (2002). It provides clues to reveal the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies and how the environment affects the growth of supermassive black holes. There are several works on it with halo mass from galaxy clustering, globular clusters dynamics and rotation curves. We use galaxy-galaxy lensing to calibrate this relation. With virial $M_{BH}$ from AGN catalogs and up-to-date KiDS1000 and UNIONS shape catalog, we obtain **the first direct measurement to $M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ relation**. Our result is roughly consistant with illustrisTNG.

  * Credit: Second author. I conducted most of measurement, modeling and tests from weak lensing side
  * Supervisor: Prof. Christopher J. Miller (University of Michigan, Umich. First author of the paper) and Prof. Wentao Luo
  * State: Most of work are completed. Paper in preparation.
  * Time: October 2021 - September 2022
  * Abstract: We use two methods, caustic (dynamical analysis in phase space) and weak lensing, to measure halo mass of clusters in C4 catalog. We campare the result and analyse the potential reasons of the difference between two kinds of mass. In this work, we also compare stacked caustic mass and individual caustic mass. This is **the first comparison analysis** between them. It helps achieve better consistant halo mass measurement and reveal more potential errors.
