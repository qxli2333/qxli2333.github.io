Hello! My name is Qinxun Li (李秦埙). Currently I am an undergraduate student from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My major is **astronomy**. Now I am visiting University of Michigan and working with Prof. Christopher Miller.

I will get my bachelor degree on July 2023. Now I am looking for PhD position to continue my education and research.

Skills
======
* Galaxy-galaxy Signal Measurement and Modeling
  * Familiar with most of popular weak lensing shape catalogs: SDSS, Decals, KiDS, UNIONS, DES and HSC.
  * Rich experience in using different measurement pipelines.
  * Rich experience to construct different ESD model according to physics.
  * Awareness of main errors of galaxy-galaxy lensing.
* Extract data from `.fits`, `.hdf5` and ASCII table.
  * Especially for catalog data
* MCMC model fitting
* Plot figures with `matplotlib`.

Research Interest
======
- Galaxy formation and evolution (*)
- Gravitational lensing (*)
- Galaxy clusters (*)
- Large scale structure
- Data mining in astrophysics 
- Cosmological constraint from large scale structure (*)
- Cosmological simulation
- Coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies (and dark matter halo)

I am only a beginner in astronomy and astrophysics with pratical experience in few fields. **So I am always very willing to participate in work of unfamiliar fields.** '*' in the list above means that I have pratical experience in that field. 

Other preparation for PhD
======
* Passing 8 graduate courses (31 credits) in math, physics and astrophysics with high grades (3.92/4.0 or 90.4/100 for these courses)
* Awareness of important telescopes and survey projects among the world
* Rich experience in international collaboration
* Rich experience in working parallel on several works
* English: TOEFL iBT score (91)
* Experience of giving talks


Research experience

* **Subhalo Properties From SDSS Satellte Lensing**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo (USTC) and Prof. Huiyuan Wang (USTC)
  * State: To be submitted to ApJ
  * Time: August 2021 - September 2022
  * Abstract: In this work, we apply galaxy-galaxy lensing, a powful method to constrain halo properties, to satellite galaxies in Yang's SDSS group catalog. With the largest lens sample among state-of-art satellite lensing works, we **find an unreported selection effect**. We develop a weighting method to correct this bias. We find that for high stellar mass satellites, there is not any strong $M_{sub}-R_{sep}$ dependence. However, for low stellar mass satellites, a 2$\sigma$ significantly positive slope is found for $\log M_{sub}-R_{sep}$. It indicates that **smaller subhalo suffers more sever tidal stripping**.
  * Key words: Subhalo, galaxy, galaxy group, extragalatic astrophysics, weak lensing, dark matter halo, tidal stripping.
  
* **Comparison between Caustic Mass and Weak Lensing Mass**
  * Credit: Second author. I conducted most of measurement, modeling and tests from weak lensing side
  * Supervisor: Prof. Christopher J. Miller (University of Michigan, Umich. First author of the paper) and Prof. Wentao Luo
  * State: Most of work are completed. Paper in preparation.
  * Time: October 2021 - September 2022
  * Abstract: We use two methods, caustic (dynamical analysis in phase space) and weak lensing, to measure halo mass of clusters in C4 catalog. We campare the result and analyse the potential reasons of the difference between two kinds of mass. In this work, we also compare stacked caustic mass and individual caustic mass. This is **the first comparison analysis** between them. It helps achieve better consistant halo mass measurement and reveal more potential errors.
  * Keywords: Dark matter halo, galaxy clusters, caustic mass, weak lensing, dynamical analysis, group finder.

* **Investigating halo properties of AGNs with CDF and VOICE**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo & Prof. Huiyuan Wang
  * Time: October 2021 - 
  * State: **Data access proposal approved**. Still working.
  * Abstract: VOICE is a deep field optical image survey with VST. It covers the region of Chandra Deep Field (CDF) survey. We use shape catalog of VOICE to investigate halo properties of AGNs and X-ray galaxies in CDF 7ms catalog.

* **$M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ Relation from Weak Lensing**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Martin Kilbinger (CEA) & Prof. Wentao Luo
  * Time: July 2022 -
  * State: **Data access proposal approved**. Primary results got, still testing.
  * Abstract: $M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ relation has been discussed since Ferrarese (2002). It provides clues to reveal the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies and how the environment affects the growth of supermassive black holes. There are several works on it with halo mass from galaxy clustering, globular clusters dynamics and rotation curves. We use galaxy-galaxy lensing to calibrate this relation. With virial $M_{BH}$ from Liu's and Shen's AGN catalogs and KiDS1000 and UNIONS shape catalog, we obtain **the first direct measurement to $M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ relation**. Our result is roughly consistant with illustrisTNG. 

* **Subhalo Scaling Relation from Weak Lensing Observation**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo, Prof. Huiyuan Wang and Prof. Houjun Mo
  * Time: July 2022 -
  * State: In preparation
  * Abstract: We combine data from several weak lensing survey to constrain parameters of subhalo-to-stellar mass relation.

* **Dark energy properties constrain from KiDS Shear Ratio Test**
  * Credit: First contributor .
  * Supervisor: Prof. Matin Kilbinger and Prof. Wentao Luo
  * Time: March 2023 - 
  * State: In preparation
  * Abstract: With well calibrated KiDS1000 photometric redshift distribution, we are trying to constrain cosmological parameters from shear ratio test.

Research Superiors
======
My research supervisors now are [Prof. Wentao Luo (罗文涛)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wentao-Luo) and [Prof. Huiyuan Wang (王慧元)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~whywang/). Prof. Luo is an expert in weak gravitational lensing. He is a active member of [HSC](https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/index.html) and [WFST](http://wfst.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). Prof. Wang is famous for his work on tidal field reconstrution from SDSS and constrain simulation project [ELUCID](https://weiguangcui.github.io/ELUCID/). They are guiding me to the right way to become an astrophysicist.

Prof. Christopher J. Miller and Prof. Martin Kilbinger are my co-supervisors. I also learn a lot from collaboration with them. Prof. Miller guides me to investigate properties of galaxy clusters.
