Hello! My name is Qinxun Li (李秦埙). Currently I am an undergraduate student from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). My major is **Astronomy**. Now I am visiting University of Michigan and working with Prof. Christopher Miller. I am a collaborator of [UNIONS](https://www.skysurvey.cc/) and [XCS](https://astro.ukzn.ac.za/~xcs/).

I will get my bachelor degree on July 2023. Now I am looking for PhD position to continue my education and research.

Research experience
======
**For more Details, see [Research Experience](research.md) and [Publication](publications.md)**
* **Subhalo Properties From SDSS Satellte Lensing**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo (USTC) and Prof. Huiyuan Wang (USTC)
  * State: To be submitted to ApJ
  * Apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to satellite galaxies in Yang's SDSS group catalog 
  * **Find an unreported selection effect** 
  * **Smaller subhalo suffers more sever tidal stripping**.

  
* **Comparison between Caustic Mass and Weak Lensing Mass**
  * Credit: Second author. I conducted most of measurement, modeling and tests from weak lensing side
  * Supervisor: Prof. Christopher J. Miller (Umich. First author of the paper) and Prof. Wentao Luo
  * State: Most of work are completed. Paper in preparation.
  * Use two methods, caustic (dynamical analysis in phase space) and weak lensing, to measure halo mass of clusters in C4 catalog.
  * **The first comparison analysis** between them. 
  * Helps achieve better consistant halo mass measurement and reveal more potential errors.

* **Investigating halo properties of AGNs with CDF and VOICE**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo & Prof. Huiyuan Wang
  * State: **Data access proposal approved**. 
  * Use shape catalog of VOICE to investigate halo properties of AGNs and X-ray galaxies in CDF 7ms catalog.

* **$M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ Relation from Weak Lensing**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Martin Kilbinger (CEA) & Prof. Wentao Luo
  * State: **Data access proposal approved**. 
  * **The first weak lensing measurement to $M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ relation**
  * Roughly consistant with illustrisTNG. 

* **Subhalo Scaling Relation from Weak Lensing Observation**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo, Prof. Huiyuan Wang and Prof. Houjun Mo
  * State: In preparation
  * Combine data from several weak lensing survey to constrain parameters of subhalo-to-stellar mass relation.

* **Dark energy properties constrain from KiDS Shear Ratio Test**
  * Credit: First author .
  * Supervisor: Prof. Matin Kilbinger and Prof. Wentao Luo
  * State: In preparation
  * Try to constrain cosmological parameters from shear ratio test with calibrated redshift distribution.

Skills
======
* Galaxy-galaxy Signal Measurement and Modeling
  * Familiar with most of popular weak lensing shape catalogs: SDSS, Decals, KiDS, UNIONS, DES and HSC.
  * Rich experience in using different measurement pipelines.
  * Rich experience to construct different ESD model according to physics.
  * Awareness of main errors of galaxy-galaxy lensing.
* Extract data from `.fits`, `.hdf5` and ASCII table.
  * Especially for catalog data
* MCMC model fitting
* Data visualization
* Programming languages: `Python` (My usual language), `IDL`, `C` and `Fortran` (Just a beginner, Fortran is so complex and difficult for humans today)

Other preparation for PhD
======
* Very good preparation in math, physics, astronomy and statistics (overall GPA: **3.78/4.3** or 3.74/4.0). *Click [Grades](grades.md) to see my courses and grades*. 
* Passing 8 graduate courses (31 credits) in math, physics and astrophysics with high grades (**3.92/4.0** or 90.4/100 for these courses)
* Awareness of important telescopes and survey projects among the world
* Rich experience in international collaboration
* Rich experience in working parallel on several works
* English: TOEFL iBT score (91)
* Experience of giving talks

Research Superiors
======
My research supervisors now are [Prof. Wentao Luo (罗文涛)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wentao-Luo) and [Prof. Huiyuan Wang (王慧元)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~whywang/). Prof. Luo is an expert in weak gravitational lensing. He is an active member of [HSC](https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/index.html) and [WFST](http://wfst.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). Prof. Wang is famous for his work on tidal field reconstrution from SDSS and constrain simulation project [ELUCID](https://weiguangcui.github.io/ELUCID/). They are guiding me to the right way to become an astrophysicist.

[Prof. Christopher J. Miller](https://lsa.umich.edu/astro/people/core-faculty/christoq.html) and [Prof. Martin Kilbinger](http://www.cosmostat.org/people/kilbinger) are my co-supervisors. I also learn a lot from collaboration with them. Prof. Miller guides me to investigate properties of galaxy clusters. 

Research Interests
======
- Galaxy formation and evolution (*)
- Gravitational lensing (*)
- Galaxy clusters (*)
- Large scale structure

I am only a beginner in astronomy and astrophysics with pratical experience in few fields. **So I am always very willing to participate in work of unfamiliar fields.** 

'*' in the list above means that I have pratical experience in that field. During my undergraduate career, my research focus on applying weak lensing technique to do astrophysics and cosmology. However, I also keep in touch with several topics such as cosmological simulation, photoz calibration, galaxy quenching, galactic dynamics, group finder, AGN feedback and so on through courses, talks, group members, collaborators and arxiv. I hope to explore wider world, or larger universe, during my graduate period.
