Hello! My name is Qinxun Li (李秦埙). Currently I am an undergraduate student from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My major is **astronomy**. Now I am visiting University of Michigan and working with Prof. Christopher Miller.

I will get my bachelor degree on July 2023. Now I am looking for PhD position to continue my education and research.

Skills
======
* Galaxy-galaxy Signal Measurement and Modeling
  * Familiar with most of popular weak lensing shape catalogs: SDSS, Decals, KiDS, UNIONS, DES and HSC.
  * Rich experience in using different measurement pipelines.
  * Rich experience to construct different ESD model according to physics.
  * Awareness of main errors of galaxy-galaxy lensing.
* Extract data from `.fits`, `.hdf5` and ASCII table.
  * Especially for catalog data
* MCMC model fitting
* Data visualization
* Programming languages: `Python` (My ), `IDL`, `C` and `Fortran` (Just a beginner, Fortran is so complex and difficult for humans today)

Research Interest
======
- Galaxy formation and evolution (*)
- Gravitational lensing (*)
- Galaxy clusters (*)
- Large scale structure
- Data mining in astrophysics 
- Cosmological constraint from large scale structure (*)
- Cosmological simulation
- Coevolution of supermassive black holes and galaxies (and dark matter halo)
- Pipeline of image survey
- More ......

I am only a beginner in astronomy and astrophysics with pratical experience in few fields. **So I am always very willing to participate in work of unfamiliar fields.** '*' in the list above means that I have pratical experience in that field. 

Other preparation for PhD
======
* Passing 8 graduate courses (31 credits) in math, physics and astrophysics with high grades (3.92/4.0 or 90.4/100 for these courses)
* Awareness of important telescopes and survey projects among the world
* Rich experience in international collaboration
* Rich experience in working parallel on several works
* English: TOEFL iBT score (91)
* Experience of giving talks


Research experience

**For more Details, see [Research Experience](research.md) and [Publication](publications.md)**
* **Subhalo Properties From SDSS Satellte Lensing**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo (USTC) and Prof. Huiyuan Wang (USTC)
  * State: To be submitted to ApJ
  * Time: August 2021 - September 2022
  * Apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to satellite galaxies in Yang's SDSS group catalog 
  * **Find an unreported selection effect** 
  * **Smaller subhalo suffers more sever tidal stripping**.

  
* **Comparison between Caustic Mass and Weak Lensing Mass**
  * Credit: Second author. I conducted most of measurement, modeling and tests from weak lensing side
  * Supervisor: Prof. Christopher J. Miller (University of Michigan, Umich. First author of the paper) and Prof. Wentao Luo
  * State: Most of work are completed. Paper in preparation.
  * Time: October 2021 - September 2022
  * Use two methods, caustic (dynamical analysis in phase space) and weak lensing, to measure halo mass of clusters in C4 catalog.
  * **The first comparison analysis** between them. 
  * Helps achieve better consistant halo mass measurement and reveal more potential errors.

* **Investigating halo properties of AGNs with CDF and VOICE**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo & Prof. Huiyuan Wang
  * Time: October 2021 - 
  * State: **Data access proposal approved**. Still working.
  * Use shape catalog of VOICE to investigate halo properties of AGNs and X-ray galaxies in CDF 7ms catalog.

* **$M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ Relation from Weak Lensing**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Martin Kilbinger (CEA) & Prof. Wentao Luo
  * Time: July 2022 -
  * State: **Data access proposal approved**. Primary results got, still testing.
  * **The first weak lensing measurement to $M_{halo}-M_{BH}$ relation**
  * Roughly consistant with illustrisTNG. 

* **Subhalo Scaling Relation from Weak Lensing Observation**
  * Credit: First author
  * Supervisor: Prof. Wentao Luo, Prof. Huiyuan Wang and Prof. Houjun Mo
  * Time: July 2022 -

Research Superiors
======
My research supervisors now are [Prof. Wentao Luo (罗文涛)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wentao-Luo) and [Prof. Huiyuan Wang (王慧元)](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~whywang/). Prof. Luo is an expert in weak gravitational lensing. He is a active member of [HSC](https://www.subarutelescope.org/Observing/Instruments/HSC/index.html) and [WFST](http://wfst.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm). Prof. Wang is famous for his work on tidal field reconstrution from SDSS and constrain simulation project [ELUCID](https://weiguangcui.github.io/ELUCID/). They are guiding me to the right way to become an astrophysicist.

Prof. Christopher J. Miller and Prof. Martin Kilbinger are my co-supervisors. I also learn a lot from collaboration with them. Prof. Miller guides me to investigate properties of galaxy clusters.
