Undergraduate Academic Annual Conference: Dark Matter Halo Mass Measurement with Galaxy-galaxy Lensing  	Talk	ustc-seminar	University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Department of Astronomy	2022-06-11	Hefei, China		This is a talk of Undergraduate Academic Annual Conference of Department of Astronomy, USTC. In this talk, I introduce basic principles of using galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure dark matter halo mass and some recent progress of two of my works, satellite lensing of SDSS and comparison between weak lensing mass and caustic mass.
Cluster Seminar: Subhalo Properties in SDSS DR7 with Galaxy-galaxy Lensing	talk	cluster-seminar	University of Michigan, Department of Astronomy	2022-10-04	Ann Arbor, US		This is a talk of cluster seminar of Department of Astronomy, Umich. In this talk, I will focus on our recent work about subhalo properties in Yang et al. (2007) 's group catalog based on SDSS DR7. We devide satellite galaxies into different stellar mass and BCG-center separation bins, then measure the lensing signals around these satellites. We discover an unreported selection effect between separation and host halo mass and use a weighting method to correct it. With a 2 free paramater model to describe excess surface density of subhalo, we fit the weighted lensing signal by MCMC. In this talk, I will first introduce galaxy-galaxy lensing method and subhalo density profile, then talk about the methods and main results of this work.
2022 PKU-DoA Undergraduate Astronomy Symposium: Subhalo Properties from SDSS Weak Lensing  	Talk	pku-symposium	Peking University, The Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics and Department of Astronomy	2022-09-23	Beijing, China		This is a talk of 2022 PKU-DoA Undergraduate Astronomy Symposium. In this talk, I introduce my work on subhalo mass measurement from SDSS weak lensing. We use Luo et al. (2017) SDSS DR7 shape catalog to study subhaloes in Yang et al. (2006) group catalog. We find an unreported selection bias between host halo mass and separation between satellite galaxies and their central galaxies. We develop a weigting method to correct this bias. With a 2 free paramater model to describe excess surface density of subhalo, we fit the weighted lensing signal by MCMC. In this talk, I will first introduce galaxy-galaxy lensing method and subhalo density profile, then talk about the methods and main results of this work. 
General Relativity Seminar 2021 Summer: An Introduction to General Relativity	Short term lectures	gr-seminar	United Academic Forum of Basic Science for Undergraduates in China	2021-07-01	Zoom	https://chaoli.club/index.php/6128	These are a series of lectures about General Relativity. The seminar is held annually United Academic Forum of Basic Science for Undergraduates, a organization aiming on improving academic levels of undergraduates in China. I am the host of 2021 summer GR seminar and give a series of lectures about basic principles and applications of general relativity. The invited talks of this seminar cover lots of topics, such as the well-posedness of Einstein equation, Lorentz geometry and casual structure, supernova and cosmic expansion and compact objects.
